# Birthday Adventures
Instead of hosting a birthday party I'm going on some local adventures all of which you are invited to:
### Friday August 8th 6:30pm: Bunker Hill Vaporwave 
Exploration of the Calvin S. Hamilton Pedway system followed by drinks in the lobby of the Bonnaventure. Business casual attire suggested.
### Saturday August 9th 5:00pm: Latin Mass/Taco Bell Cantina
Latin Vigil Mass at St. Thomas the Apostle, Hollywood follwed by walk to Taco Bell Cantina for chalupas and bad drinks. Side quest: get a photo with an aggressive Marvel character and debate with Black Israelites. 
### Friday August 15th ?: Sprouts Echo Park Grand Opening
### Saturday August 16th 12:00pm: Cats, Cats, Cats
### Sunday August 17th Dubai Chocolate and hangout at Sasquatch HQ
### August 21st 1:00pm Angelus Temple Tour
### August 24th 2:00pm K-Town BBQ and Desserts
### How This Works
All you need to do is sign up, via Eventbright to whatever interests you. Details are on Eventbright. Here's the plan:

### The Rules
How old am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/n6R7-Npe1-U?si=nzxiz0z7zRDeSlVR">When this happened</a> I was already in my third year.
